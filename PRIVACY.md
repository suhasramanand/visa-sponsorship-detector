# Privacy Policy - Visa Sponsorship Detector

**Last updated:** February 2026

## Overview

Visa Sponsorship Detector is a Chrome extension that helps job seekers identify visa and sponsorship restrictions on job listing pages. We take your privacy seriously.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

- The extension processes page text locally on your device solely to detect visa restriction keywords
- No page content, job data, or personal information is sent to external servers
- No analytics, tracking, or telemetry are used

## Local Storage

The extension uses Chrome's local storage only to save your preferences:

- **Extension on/off** – whether detection is enabled
- **Highlight toggle** – whether matched text is highlighted on the page

These settings remain on your device and are never shared.

## Permissions

- **storage** – Saves your preferences (enable/disable, highlight toggle) locally
- **activeTab** – Allows the popup to communicate with the current tab
- **Host access** – Required to run on job sites (LinkedIn, Indeed, Workday, etc.) to scan page text. All processing happens locally.
